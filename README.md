# COMP8118_project-Traffic-volume-prediction
This repo is for our term project for data Mining course.

**Dataset Used:** 

Hourly Interstate 94 Westbound traffic volume data for MN DoT ATR station 301, at Minneapolis and St Paul, MN. It is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data set contains 48,204 instances of hourly traffic data collected between 2012 and 2018 with a total of 9 attributes such as holiday type, temperature, rain fall, snow, clouds, weather etc.

**Goal:**

Estimate the Hourly Traffic volume.

**How to Run the Project:**

The project code is located at the root directory in 'DM_Project_metro_interstate_traffic_volume.ipynb'. Since this is a Jupyter notebook file, to run each section of the code, a person only needs to have the Jupyter Notebook environment installed in their device and then open the file and click on 'Run' to see output for that code section. 

Make sure you have the following packages available/installed:
- Scikit-learn (Sk-Learn)
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas

To install a specific library from Jupyter notebook directly, the following link is helpful:

Usually Anaconda distribution is installed then most of these packages will be included in Anaconda.
